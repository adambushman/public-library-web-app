# Public Library Web Application

A web application for a public library system built in PHP.

## Description

A collaboration between [Isaac Monson](https://github.com/isaacmonson), [Franco Barbiero](https://github.com/Francoranco4), and [Adam Bushman](https://github.com/adambushman). This is a featured group project for [Web Based Applications](https://class-schedule.app.utah.edu/main/1124/description.html?subj=IS&catno=6465&section=001) (IS 6564), an elective for the Eccles Business School master programs: MS Information Systems and MS Business Analytics. 

This project features a web application for a public library, providing members of the surrounding community access to books, periodicals, movies, music, etc. The application supports user use cases (registration, searching for materials, check-out/returns, etc) and administrative use cases (managing inventory, registration, reports, etc). Achieving a pleasurable user experience is a key objective as many public library systems leave much to be desired on this front.
