## Database Explanation

Use `create-db.sql` to create the database structure and then populate it with `populate-db.sql`. I've added a temporary message in the navbar indicating if the connection was successful. You may need to edit the `dbauth.php` settings to represent the right sign-in settings depending on your device.

All user passwords have the following format:

*   First initial
*   Last name
*   '123!'

Example: 'bsmith123!'

I've updated the ERD diagram. Should it need to be updated again, open `library-erd.drawio` in Draw.io via the browser. After making changes, save as and then export as a .jpg.
